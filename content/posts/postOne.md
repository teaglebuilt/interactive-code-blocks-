If your CSS is setup to default to light mode, but the user selects dark mode, the next time they visit your app, they will be in dark mode. However, the user will see a flash of light mode before the app is spun up and useDarkMode is called.

To prevent this, I've included some vanilla JavaScript that you can insert in your index.html just after the <body> tag. It is in a file named noflash.js.txt. You can either insert the contents of this file in a <script> tag or automate the step in your build process.

Note that if you change any of the default—such as storageKey or classNameDark for example—the noflash.js file will need to be modified with the same values.

```python

def function(param):
  return something

```
