<challenge id="1" title="test">

This is a code exercise. The content can be formatted in simple Markdown – so
you can have **bold text**, `code` or [links](https://spacy.io) or lists, like
the one for the instructions below.

- These are instructions and they can have bullet points.
- The code block below will look for the files `exc_01_03`, `solution_01_03` and
  `test_01_03` in `/exercises`.
